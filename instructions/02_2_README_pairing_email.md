Hi,

For the "pairing at office" challenge, you are expected prepare at home and then come into the office to pair 
with one or more of our developers.

Attached is a python application. There is a README.md file which explains the application.

You should get it running on your laptop. 
We will be using your laptop during the pairing challenge so that you are familiar with it. 

For the pairing challenge, we will be considering the following:
* What does your code look like? 
    * Can you write clean code?
* What sort of testing do you do?
    * Do you know how to write tests?
* How are your software engineering skills?
    * Can you analyse the application and solve problems
* Your team communication skills?
    * Do you ask questions and explain what you are doing?

You will notice that the application only includes the standard python libraries (i.e. no external dependencies can be used).
This is deliberate and will be required during the pairing session.

The tests can include whatever dependencies you want.


**Your at-home warm up task**

Once you have the application running, you should familiarise yourself with it since we will be working on it during the pairing challenge.
As a warm-up, there is currently a bug in the application.

When the app is run as specified in the "Sample Output" section in the README.md, the output is not what is expected.

Please diagnose and fix the bug.


Best of luck.

Kind regards,
