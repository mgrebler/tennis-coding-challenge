Hi,

For the "all at home" challenge, you are expected to write a python application to address the attached readme.


We will be considering the following:
* What does your code look like? 
    * Can you write clean code?
* What sort of testing do you do?
    * Do you know how to write tests?
    * Do you do Test Driven Development?
* How are your software engineering skills?
    * Is what you have written in roughly the direction of solving the problem?

The reason we do this challenge is to get an understanding of the type of code you write.
Whilst accuracy is an important part of software engineering, we are not too concerned if the solution isn't 100% correct.
We can still understand your code if it isn't correct or even doesn't run properly.

For your submission we expect a zipped file containing your python application, including tests. 
We also expect you to create a short readme file briefly explaining your solution (a paragraph or so), as well as an assumptions you made.

The application must only include the standard python libraries (i.e. no external dependencies can be used).

Your tests can include whatever dependencies you want.

Attached are the README.md file, explaining the application, and a txt file with sample input.

Best of luck.

Kind regards,
