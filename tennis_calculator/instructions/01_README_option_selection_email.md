Hi,

As we discussed the next stage of the interview process is a coding challenge for us to understand what sort of code you write.

You have two options:

1. **All at home**: 
    * In this option, we will describe a set of requirements which will require you to write a python application to implement the requirements
    * Expected time: 10 hours at home
    * There is no strict deadline, but the expectation is that you would complete it in about a week
        * If you need more time, that is not an issue either, please let us know
        * This will allow you to solve the problem in your own time in an environment that you are comfortable
    * Once you have completed the project you will submit your code back to us for evaluation
1. **Pairing at our office**
    * In this option, we will describe a similar set of requirements to the option above, but we will also provide code that solves the problem
    * Expected time: 1.5 hours at home, 1.5 hours in our office
    * You will be required to get the program running on your laptop at home, and solve a simple problem in that program
    * Then you will come into our office to do a some pairing work with us on that program
    *   For example, extending the program, and refactoring some of it

Please let me know your preference.

Kind regards,
